                Girl Talk is the most widely recognized mash-up artist. He makes music by sampling different
                songs to construct an original collage filled with nostalgia triggers. This goal of this game is to
                score
                points
                by accurately guessing artists and songs he samples on each of the following tracks. Only primary
                artists
                are
                accepted (as opposed to featured artists) and the answers are not case sensitive. Answers can be
                submitted
                by
                hitting "Enter" or clicking on the "Submit" button. Submit artist names and song names separately.
                (rules to
                be updated as more
                features for the game are implemented.)

            <p id="difficulty">A word on the difficulty of this quiz. This quiz is just for fun. It is, in a sense, a
                celebration of Girl Talk's music. It is not intentionally difficult, but it implicitly is as a result of
                his
                eclectic taste in music. If you get two correct answers on a song and you are not familiar with Girl
                Talk or
                a <em>lot</em> of hip-hop, then you should be happy about your score. In the making of this quiz, I
                learned
                that I was wrong about an artist and a song title! So don't feel bad. Just listen to the song, and when
                you
                think you know something, enter it as a guess to see if you are right.</p>
