                <p class="content">
                    Girl Talk is the most widely recognized mash-up artist. He makes music by sampling different
                    songs to construct original collages triggering deep feelings of nostalgia. Inevitably, when
                    listening
                    to his music you try to figure out what songs he has sampled. This is that game. It is not easy, so
                    do
                    not be stressed about your score. This is only meant to enhance the listening experience.

                    The goal of this game is to score points by accurately guessing artists and songs he samples on each
                    of
                    the following tracks. Only primary artists are accepted (as opposed to featured artists) and the
                    answers
                    are not case sensitive. Answers can be submitted by hitting "Enter" or clicking on the "Submit"
                    button.
                    Submit artist names and song names separately. (rules to be updated as more features for the game
                    are
                    implemented.)

                <p class="content">A word on the difficulty of this quiz. This quiz is just for fun. It is, in a sense,
                    a
                    celebration of Girl Talk's music. It is not intentionally difficult, but it implicitly is as a
                    result of
                    his eclectic taste in music. If you get two correct answers on a song and you are not familiar with
                    Girl
                    Talk or a <em>lot</em> of hip-hop, then you should be happy about your score. In the making of this
                    quiz, I learned that I was wrong about an artist and a song title! So don't feel bad. Just listen to
                    the
                    song, and when you think you know something, enter it as a guess to see if you are right.</p>
