                <p class="content">This quiz is not intentionally difficult. Anything over 10% on a song is a really
                    good score. In the making of this quiz, I learned that I was mistaken about an artist and a song
                    title! If you think you know something, enter it as a guess to see if you are right, incorrect
                    guesses are not penalized.</p>
