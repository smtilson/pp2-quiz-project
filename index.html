    <h2 id="subtitle">The Girl Talk quiz we all play in our heads.</h2>
    <div id="introduction">
        <p id="instructions">
            Girl Talk is the most widely recognized mash-up artist. He makes music by sampling different
            songs to construct an original collage filled with nostalgia triggers. This goal of this game is to score
            points
            by accurately guessing artists and songs he samples on each of the following tracks. Only primary artists
            are
            accepted (as opposed to featured artists) and the answers are not case sensitive. Answers can be submitted
            by
            hitting "Enter" or clicking on the "Submit" button. Submit artist names and song names separately. (rules to
            be updated as more
            features for the game are implemented.)
        </p>
        <p id="difficulty">A word on the difficulty of this quiz. This quiz is just for fun. It is, in a sense, a
            celebration of Girl Talk's music. It is not intentionally difficult, but it implicitly is as a result of his
            eclectic taste in music. If you get two correct answers on a song and you are not familiar with Girl Talk or
            a <em>lot</em> of hip-hop, then you should be happy about your score. In the making of this quiz, I learned
            that I was wrong about an artist and a song title! So don't feel bad. Just listen to the song, and when you
            think you know something, enter it as a guess to see if you are right.</p>
