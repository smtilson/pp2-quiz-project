                <p class="content">
                    Girl Talk is the most widely recognized mash-up artist. He makes music by sampling different
                    songs to construct original collages triggering deep feelings of nostalgia. Inevitably, when
                    listening to his music you try to figure out what songs he has sampled. This is that game. It very
                    challenging, but the point is to enhance the listening experience.

                    The goal of this game is to accurately guess the artists and songs that are sampled on each song.
                    Only primary artists are accepted. Answers can be submitted by hitting "Enter" or clicking on the
                    "Submit" button. Submit either an artist name and or a song name.

                <h3 class="content-header">Warning:</h3>
                <p class="content">Regarding difficulty, this quiz is not intentionally difficult. It implicitly
                    challenging is as a result of Girl Talk's eclectic taste in music. Two correct answers on a song is
                    a good score. In the making of this quiz, I learned that I was mistaken about an artist and a song
                    title! If you think you know something, enter it as a guess to see if you are right.</p>
